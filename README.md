# fillit
Program that looks for the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing.

Fillit is a Hivr Helsinki project. During this porohect, I familiarized myself with a recurring problematic in programming: searching for the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities in a respectable timing. In this particular project, the objective was to find a way to assemble a given Tetriminos set in the smallest possible square in shortest time possible, despite an exponentially growing number of possibilities each time a piece is added.

A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to the popular game Tetris.

How to run:
- git clone the repository
- run command make
- an executable called fillit will be created
-usage: ./fillit [test-file-name]
